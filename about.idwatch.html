      <p>ID Watch starts with friendship! It all started as we were cutting the grass together one summer to earn some small pocket money, we would have long discussions: Our goal was clear and we aimed at complementing each other’s skills to later on create a watch brand that would transform Swiss heritage into World’s heritage.</p>
